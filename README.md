# bit_set

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Bitset class. The Bitset class allows you to efficiently manipulate and store a collection of bits.

## Introduction

The Bitset class provides a way to manage a set of bits efficiently.
It is designed to handle a large number of bits and perform operations like setting and resetting individual bits. 
The implementation uses an array of unsigned integers to store the bits.
